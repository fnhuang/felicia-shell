# COMP0010 Shell

COMP0010 Shell is a [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) created for educational purposes. 
Similarly to other shells, it provides a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop), an interactive environment that allows users to execute commands. COMP0010 Shell has a simple language for specifying commands that resembles [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)). This language allows, for example, calling applications and connecting the output of one application to the input of another application through a [pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)). COMP0010 Shell also provides its own implementations of widely-used UNIX applications for file system and text manipulation: [echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_(command)), [ls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ls), [cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)), etc.

The final code written by me implemented 3 software design patterns: 
- decorator for Unsafe application call
- factory for create application
- transformer implemented with lark to traverse down the tree of commands
